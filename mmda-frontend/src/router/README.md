# Router

The [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) helps to implement a Single Page Applications. A single route includes and points to a View.

The router also takes care of managing public and private pages.

    - public pages: accessable to everyone.
    - private pages: require a user to login via /login.
    - All pages are private by default. Specific routes are excluded using an array.
