    "headline1": "Introducing MMDA: An interactive toolkit for Corpus-based Discourse Analysis",
    "paragraph1": "Corpus-based discourse analysis is a popular and highly successful technique for the investigation of socio-political research questions (see e.g. Baker 2006; McEnery et al. 2015). The CDA procedure starts from collocation analyses for selected subcorpora and/or keyword analyses of suitable (sub-)corpora. Collocates (or keywords) are then grouped into categories thatare supposed to reflect discursive positions, i.e. attitudes towards the topic. These interpretations are verified and refined by careful inspection of the corresponding KWIC concordances.",
    "paragraph2": "In our contribution, we present an interactive software toolkit called MMDA (for mixed-methods discourse analysis), which enables the user to carry out multiple collocation analysesin parallel and which visualizes the results in an intuitive way. The user can try out differentparameter settings in real time, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of thesemantic space of the discourse.",
    "paragraph3": "From a Digital Humanities perspective, our approach can be understood as an attempt to blend close and distant reading techniques. Our visualization is a two-dimensional semantically structured map of the discourse, based on wordembeddings (cf. Mikolov et al. 2018), which we created for the respective linguistic registers. The MMDA toolkit represents a first step towards a more sophisticated CDA methodology."

  "about": {
    "headline1": "The Toolkit",
    "paragraph1_1": "Given the widespread use of Corpus-based Discourse Analysis (CDA) and recent advances in computational linguistic techniques, it is surprising that researchers still have to rely on general-purpose corpus tools such as CQPweb (Hardie 2012). There is no dedicated software solution that combines the necessary steps of CDA into a single consistent and efficient working environment.",
    "paragraph1_2": "The MMDA toolkit represents a first step towards a more sophisticated CDA methodology, in which the manual categorization procedure is operationalized in terms of so-called discoursemes, groups of related collocates that form building blocks of discursive positions.",
    "headline2": "The Workflow",
    "paragraph2_1": "Initially, the researcher carries chooses one or more lexical items as a starting point for a collocation analysis. From this a two-dimensional visualization is created, this represents the semantically structured map of the discourse.",
    "paragraph2_2": "In this interactive map, the researcher can groups of related collocates into discoursemes.",
    "headline3": "What is a discourseme?",
    "paragraph3_1": "A discourseme is a user-created list of releated collocates. On its surface, a simple list of lexical items, which the researched decided belong together.",
    "paragraph3_2": "They are used to form a discursive position.",
    "headline4": "What is a discursive position?",
    "paragraph4_1": "A discursive position represents an attitudes towards a topic. On the surface, a user-created list of previously created discoursemes.",
