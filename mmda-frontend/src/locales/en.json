    "headline1": "MMDA: An interactive toolkit for Corpus-based Discourse Analysis",
    "paragraph1": "Corpus-based Discourse Analysis (CDA) is a popular and highly successful technique for the investigation of socio-political research questions.  The CDA procedure starts from a collocation analysis for a given node (oftentimes representing a topic of interest).  The collocates are then grouped into semantically meaningful categories (e.g. attitudes and opinions) based on careful inspection of the corresponding KWIC concordances.",
    "paragraph2": "The web application you are using here – the interactive Mixed Methods Discourse Analysis (MMDA) toolkit – is a bespoke software solution that combines the necessary steps of CDA into a single consistent and efficient working environment. The most labour-intensive task of CDA, the manual grouping of lexical items into discoursemes, can be carried out interactively via drag & drop.",
    "paragraph3": "From a Digital Humanities perspective, the toolkit can be understood as an attempt to blend close and distant reading techniques.  On the one hand, the app provides you with an intuitive visualization of collocation profiles in form of a semantic map.   On the other hand, easily accessible and exportable concordance lines accompany all summarizations.",

  "about": {
    "headline": "MMDA Toolkit Vignette",
    "headline1": "Functionality and Prerequisites",
    "paragraph1_1": "The MMDA toolkit can be used in a specialized way to (1) query corpora using the Corpus Query Processor (CQP) of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CWB), (2) to visualize collocation lists via semantic maps, (3) to create and store discoursemes (see below) in a consistent database, and (4) to analyse discourseme constellations.  In principle, any corpus indexed with the CWB can be imported in the toolkit.  For all visualzations, word embeddings of the respective token-layer (for the given language and register) must be at hand.",
    "headline1_1": "Using MMDA for CDA",
    "paragraph1_2": "A typical starting point of CDA is a 'topic query': a set of tokens and multi-token units on any positional annotation layer of the corpus. The available layers depend on the actual linguistic annotation of the corpus at hand, but for most corpora the two layers 'word' and 'lemma' should be present. A typical topic query is made up of semantically related topic nodes such as {'erneuerbar Energie', 'Windenergie', 'Solarenergie', 'Wasserkraft'}, which aim to capture a specific topic you are interested in. For a topic in the sense of CDA, it is reasonable to query on the lemma layer, i.e. to set p-query and p-collocation to 'lemma' in the 'New' pane.",
    "paragraph1_3": "The 'context' and 'context break' parameters determine the windows around the retrieved topic nodes that will be highlighted in concordance views and which will be used to determine the domain of collocate candidates. For most corpora, sentences ('s') should be used as break points. Newspaper texts might also contain 'article' or 'p' (for paragraph); CMC data might contain 'tweet' or 'post'; the most generic s-break value is 'text'. Typical values for the window size are 3 to 10, although some researchers might be interested in values as low as 1 (essentially looking for trigrams), others in window sizes of 10 and above, looking for patterns across lexical items far away from one another.",
    "headline2": "Discoursems Analyses",
    "paragraph2_1": "The immediate result of the analysis is a summarization of the cotext (the textual context defined by window size and s-break) of the topic nodes: You can see (1) the frequency breakdown of the query. (2) The 'associated discoursemes' pane lets you associate discoursemes with the analysis, so that they are visualized in the semantic map and in concordance lines. (3) The concordance lines show the matches in KWIC view. (4) The collocation table presents the collocate candidates of the topic nodes for different association measures subject to window size. Lastly, (5) the 'meta distribution' segment shows you the distribution of the matches across all annotated s-attributes.",
    "paragraph2_2": "A semantic map of the words (or lemmas) in the collocation list can be displayed. The initial map is a straightforward visualization of the collocation table: It uses a stochastic dimensionality reduction algorithm to place the lexical items in a semantically structured two-dimensional plane (especially trying to place semantically similar items next to one another). The size of each lexical item represents the association of the item with the topic discourseme; collocation parameters can be used for changing the appearance of the semantic map.",
      "paragraph2_3": "",
    "headline3": "Forming discoursemes",
    "paragraph3_1": "A discourseme is a user-created selection of related lexical items. On its surface, it represents a simple list of lexical items, which the researcher decided that belong together. The list of topic nodes form a special discourseme – the topic discourseme.",
    "paragraph3_2": "The semantic map is interactive, meaning that lexical items can be grouped together via drag & drop to form additional discoursemes. The cloud can also display second-order collocates of a selected discourseme in the same semantic map, i.e. lexical items that are highly associated with the co-occurrence of the topic discourseme and the selected discourseme. Clicking on items in the semantic cloud retrieves concordances for co-occurrences of the respective item and the topic query.",
    "headline4": "Forming Constellations",
    "paragraph4_1": "The easiest discourseme constellation that can be formed consists of a topic discourseme and one further a group of collocates. Such a constellation consists of the topic (realized by the topic discourseme) and a certain perspective that can be taken towards that topic (realized by the second discourseme). After creating a constellation, you can inspect pairwise textual associations and actual concordance lines of the constellation across corpora."
