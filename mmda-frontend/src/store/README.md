# Vuex Store

The [Vuex store](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) is used for state management across different components.

Also: all backend API call are implemented here using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

The store is namespaced, meaning each logical unit has its own store. Example:

    - modules/discourseme
    - modules/users
    - modules/someotherobject
